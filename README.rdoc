= Redmine Issue Importer

This plugin seems to be functional now,
including in multiprocess environments.
I got rid of the use of instance variables to pass
data from the match stge to the result stage.
At this point, it's using the session support
to pass the data, so extremely large import files
could use a bit of extra memory on the server.
