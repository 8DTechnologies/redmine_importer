= Redmine Issue Importer

This plugin is broken and should not be used.  If the use of it is
required, the only option is to run it in a single process, such as
WEBrick.  Running this in a multi-process/thread environment will almost
guaranteed run in to errors due to a global variable that was used by
the initial author.
